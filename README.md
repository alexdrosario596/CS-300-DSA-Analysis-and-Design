    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    For project one in this course, we were tasked to evaluate the run time of different data structures that we learned about throughout the course. The data stuctures include vector, hash table and binary search tree. For project two, we were assigned to develop a code that could read data from a text file, load a data structure, create a menu, and print course information in alphabetical order as well as upon request of a course.
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    To approach the problem I first analyzed what the projects were asking me to do and the requirements needed to complete the project. I chose the appropriate data structure for the project depending on what was needed from the project. I used techniques such as algorithms and optimizing code to develop an appropriate program for the assignment. Data structures are important to understand because it allows for efficient manipulation of data.
    
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    A roadblock I encountered was deciding which data strcuture to implement for the second project. After deciding which data structure to use, I then encountered the problem of how to implement the data stucture itself into the code. I overcame these roadblocks by looking over the zybooks notes and doing some research online. Breaking down the problem into smaller parts also helped me to better overcome the problems I encountered when implementing the data stucture.
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    My approach to designing software and developing programs has improved alot, especially understanding data structures and algorithms. I also got a lot of practice in considering pros and cons when choosing an appropriate data structure based on the projects problem. Certain skills such as testing and documentation have also improved thanks to the assignment of these projects.
    
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    The way that I write programs that are maintainable, readable and adaptable has evolved thanks to the work done in these projects. Writing more clear and concise code is definitely something that I needed more practice with and I achieved to do that by working on project two. My use of comments and making sure they are understandable to a user who is looking at the code for the first time has also improved.
